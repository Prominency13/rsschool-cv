### Shortly about myself:
The major part of my life starting from my birth is conntected with the wolrd of IT. Everything began since in my early ages I've turned on my home PC for a first time and everything went on: I've been getting to know how to work with Windows OS, finished many logical computer games, learned how to fix and combine details inside my PC. In my 13 I've had an interest to study the construction of WEB-sites, and so I've learned that every WEB-site is in such need of the hypertext markup language as human being needs bones, cascade sylesheets are as human's skin and the muscles of every WEB-site may be one of many programming languages, for that time I knew about JavaScript and Php. Subsequently I went to IT University and started studying C++, Java and Python as well. In 2021 I graduated 3d course of Belarussian State University of Information Technologies and Radioelectronics, so I'm fond of getting new knowledges in programming and AI sphere. Nowadays I know how to use such programming languages as Java, C++, Python, and a bit of JavaScript.
Here is one of common code-tasks completed in codewars: 
```n(int number) {
    int sum = 0;
    if(number > 0){
      for(int i=0; i<number; i++){
       if((i%3 == 0 || i%5 == 0) & !(i%3 == 0 && i%5 == 0)){
          sum += i;
        }
    }
  }
  return sum;
  }
}
```
